# Mesh
Methods for creating 2-dimensional meshes using the `DistMesh` method are contained in the module,

Meshes are stored as a set of node positions and triangles in column-major format in `Mesh`. A 2-dimensional mesh can be generated by defining a signed distance function $\mbox{d:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}}$ and desired truss element length $\mbox{h:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}}$, and passing to the `Mesh` constructor.
